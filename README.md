## Synopsis

A quick script to initialize [firebase-admin](https://www.npmjs.com/package/firebase-admin).

## Code Example

Set the following environment variables:

	FIREBASE_PRIVATE_KEY
	FIREBASE_PROJECT_ID
	FIREBASE_CLIENT_EMAIL
	FIREBASE_DB_URL

Then simply do `const admin = require('init-firebase-admin')` and use as per normal.


## Motivation

I have several small node projects that interface with my Firebase project and I found myself repeating this initialization code over and over.

## Installation

	npm install init-firebase-admin
